# cyclistic-case-study
The principal task is to analyse the data and identify the trends of how annual members and casual riders of a cycle-sharing company ‘Cyclistic’ use their service differently to gain insights for coming up with a marketing campaign whose goal is to convert casual riders into annual members. An additional task is to suggest recommendations based on the analysis.

Employed multiple software applications (Microsoft Excel for data preparation, Big Query for data cleaning, R for analysis and Tableau for creating a data visualization) to incorporate all the tools learnt in Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. BigQuery was used since the dataset was too large to load quickly in MySQL workbench.
