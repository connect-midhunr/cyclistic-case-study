## :floppy_disk: Project Files Description</h2>

<p>This project contains an executable iPython Notebook, an R executable file and the data visualization as follows:</p>
<h4>Executable Files:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Cyclistic Case Study.ipynb</b> - Google Colab notebook containing data summary, data cleaning, exploration, visualisations and conclusion.</li>
  <li><b>Analysis.R</b> - R code for generating plots.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Images:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data Visualization.png</b> - Dashboard created using Tableau.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Source Directory:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data & Resources.zip</b> - Includes booking data  for both hotels.</li>
</ul>

## :floppy_disk: Project Description

Employed multiple software applications (Microsoft Excel for data preparation, Big Query for data cleaning, R for analysis and Tableau for creating a data visualization) to incorporate all the tools learnt in Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. BigQuery was used since the dataset was too large to load quickly in MySQL workbench.

## :book: Problem Statement

The principal task is to analyse the data and identify the trends of how annual members and casual riders of a cycle-sharing company â€˜Cyclisticâ€™ use their service differently to gain insights for coming up with a marketing campaign whose goal is to convert casual riders into annual members. An additional task is to suggest recommendations based on the analysis.

## :book: Approach

1.	Understanding the business task.
2.	Import relevant libraries and define useful functions.
3.	Reading data from files given.
4.	Data inspection.
5.  Data cleaning.
6.	Exploratory data analysis, to find which factors affect the customer usage and how they affect it.
7.  Create a dashboard with relevant information.
8.	Conclusions drawn from analysis.

## :book: Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA was done on:
<li>Total Number of Rides Categorized by User Type.</li>
<li>Total Duration of Rides Categorized by User Type.</li>
<li>Average Duration of Ride Categorized by User Type.</li>
<li>Number of Rides of each type of Bike by Annual Members for each Month of the Year.</li>
<li>Number of Rides of each type of Bike by Casual Members for each Month of the Year.</li>
<li>Total Number of Rides for each Hour of the Day Categorized by User Type.</li>
<li>Total Duration of Rides for each Hour of the Day Categorized by User Type.</li>
<li>Average Duration of Rides for each Hour of the Day Categorized by User Type.</li>
<li>Total Number of Rides for each Day of the Week Categorized by User Type.</li>
<li>Total Duration of Rides for each Day of the Week Categorized by User Type.</li>
<li>Average Duration of Rides for each Day of the Week Categorized by User Type.</li>
<li>Total Number of Rides for each Month of the Year Categorized by User Type.</li>
<li>Total Duration of Rides for each Month of the Year Categorized by User Type.</li>
<li>Average Duration of Rides for each Month of the Year Categorized by User Type.</li>
<li>Location of the Docking Stations.</li>
Charts used for analyses are bar graph, pie chart and map.

## ðŸ“˜: Conclusion

<li>Number of rides: Annual members ride 1.2 times as much as casual riders.</li>
<li>Type of bike: Electric bikes seem to be the most popular choice among the three types of bikes.</li>
<li>Length of rides: On average, casual riders tend to ride 2.3 times longer than annual members.</li>
<li>Hour of the day: Annual members tend to use the bikes 1.5 times more than casual riders during the rush hours. Otherwise, the usage is almost identical.</li>
<li>Day of the week: Casual riders tend to ride more and longer than annual members during the weekend. Weekends seem to be the most popular days as both annual members and casual riders alike take longer rides on weekends.</li>
<li>Month of the Year: The frequency of rides surges in summer and dips in winter. Summer is the only season where casual riders take more rides than annual members.
<li>Location: Downtown Chicago is the most popular location for riding for both types of users.</li>

The following are the differences between annual members and casual riders that were found based on the above insights derived from the analysis:
<li>Annual members: Use the bikes more during weekdays, particularly during rush hours, have a shorter average trip duration, most probably because they use it only when it's necessary and relatively less drop off during the winter months compared to casual customers since they mostly use the service regularly.</li>
<li>Casual riders: Use the bikes more on the weekend, for traveling to and from recreational areas especially during the afternoon hours with a longer average trip duration, probably to make the most out of their single-ride passes and significantly less use during winter months since they mostly use the service for leisure activities. Casual riders also become significantly more active during the summer months when a lot of outdoor activities take place.</li>

From this information, we can hypothesize that annual members use the service for commuting purposes and casual riders for recreational purposes but solid conclusions cannot be drawn from this information as we do not possess the personal and professional details of any users like age, gender, profession, motivation aspects like environment, health or finance etc.
The company is missing out on a huge chunk of revenue by not charging rides proportional to the duration of the trip since the number of rides taken by both types of users are almost the same.

## ðŸ“˜: Recommendations

There are two possible ways in which we can proceed, among which only one must be chosen:
1.  Collect more data.
2.  Proceed with the insights from the available data.

The selection of one from the above two ways depends on how early the business decisions need to be taken. If decisions need to be taken immediately it is best to choose the second option, otherwise, the first option will be suitable.
